# tClamp18
tClamp18 offers a series of Igor Pro GUIs for data acquision via an InstruTECH ITC-18 AD/DA board. tClampt18 is optimized for whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in both voltage-clamp and current-clamp modes but it can be used for general data acquision purposes as well. tClamp18 also offers a quite flexible setting ablity harnessing 8 ADCs and 4 DACs with usefull template. Thus, it is an ideal solution for simultaneous multi-cellular whole-cell recordings with several patch-clamp amplifiers (Axon, HEKA, Werner, DAGAN, Nihon Kohden etc.). It also has a quite virsatile stimulus ability with a virtual 4 channel stimulator and internal timer for timing and with any waveforms.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* IGOR Pro 6 (https://www.wavemetrics.com/)
* InstruTECH ITC-18 and a host interface (http://www.heka.com/products/products_main.html#acq_itc18)
* Driver software of ITC-18 (http://www.heka.com/downloads/downloads_main.html#down_acq)
* ITC-18 legacy XOP for Igor Pro 6.x (ITC18_X86_V76.XOP) (http://www.heka.com/downloads/downloads_main.html#down_xops)

### Test
This code has been tested in Igor Pro version 6.3.7.2. for Windows and supposed to work in Igor Pro 6.1 or later.
This code is supposed to work for Windows Vista, 7, 8, 10 and Mac X also, but tested only in Windows XP and 7.
This code is supposed to work any host interfaces (PCI-18, PCI-18V3, or USB-18), but tested only with USB-18.
